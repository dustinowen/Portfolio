    "bio": "I pursued a Computer Science degree in college however, my career path diverged as I accepted a managerial role with a reputable hospitality group. During my tenure with this group I progressed from an entry-level management position under the direct leadership within my store, to a multi-unit Operations Manager. I faced a multitude of challenges, ranging from hiring, training, and developing teams to making sound decisions that consistently enhanced our guests’ experience.",
    "bio2": "While I enjoyed the success of my position, my strong affinity for technology persisted. I found myself naturally drawn to projects involving software challenges, fueling my passion for coding. Although I will always carry the customer-centric values instilled in me during my time in hospitality, I am now determined to seek deeper career fulfillment by returning to my coding roots. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to apply the skills I've acquired and to infuse my consumer-first business outlook into future teams."
